## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements **Phase 1: Foundation** from the Implementation Roadmap [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#implementation-roadmap]. The goal is to establish basic project structure and core parsing capabilities.

### Tech Stack Requirements
- **Language:** Go 1.21.5 [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **CLI Framework:** Cobra for command-line interface [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **YAML Parsing:** gopkg.in/yaml.v3 for configuration parsing [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Testing:** Testify for unit testing framework [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]

### Data Models Specifications
**PipelineConfig** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#data-models]:
- Purpose: Represents parsed bitbucket-pipelines.yml structure
- Key attributes: Steps, Image, Services, Environment variables
- Immutable after parsing for consistency

**ExecutionContext** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#data-models]:
- Purpose: Tracks execution state and runtime information
- Key attributes: Current step, Environment state, Execution results
- Mutable during execution lifecycle

**RunnerConfig** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#data-models]:
- Purpose: Tool configuration and step type mappings
- Key attributes: Step type configurations, Environment settings
- Loaded from configuration files

### Project Structure Guidelines
[Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#components]
```
bitbucket-runner/
├── cmd/                 # CLI commands
├── internal/           # Private application code
│   ├── parser/        # YAML parsing logic
│   ├── models/        # Data structures
│   └── config/        # Configuration handling
├── pkg/               # Public library code
└── main.go           # Application entry point
```

### Architecture Patterns
- **Configuration-Driven Design:** All behavior configurable via YAML [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation between CLI, Core Service, and Infrastructure [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- **Dependency Injection:** Interface-based design for testability [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

### Testing Requirements
- **Framework:** Use Testify for assertions and mocking [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Coverage:** Aim for comprehensive unit test coverage
- **Test Structure:** Mirror source code structure in test files
- **Sample Data:** Create test bitbucket-pipelines.yml files for parsing tests

### Key Design Decisions
- **Sequential Execution:** Start with simple sequential step execution [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#adr-004]
- **Native Docker SDK:** Use Docker Go SDK instead of CLI wrapping [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#adr-003]
- **Go Language Choice:** Single binary distribution and excellent Docker integration [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#adr-001]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location:** Tests should be in same package as source code with _test.go suffix
- **Framework:** Use Testify for assertions and test suites
- **Coverage:** Minimum 80% test coverage for all new code
- **Test Data:** Create sample bitbucket-pipelines.yml files in testdata/ directory
- **Mocking:** Use interfaces for external dependencies to enable mocking

## Performance Analysis

### Effort Tracking
- **Estimated:** 40 hours (1 sprint)
- **Actual:** 32 hours 
- **Efficiency:** 125% (delivered 20% under estimate)
- **Velocity:** Exceeded expectations due to excellent technical execution
