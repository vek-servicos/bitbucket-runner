# Story 1.2: Execution Engine

## Status
Approved

## Business Value
**Investment:** ~40 hours (1 sprint)  
**ROI:** Enables core product functionality, unlocking local pipeline execution capability  
**Market Impact:** Differentiates from competitors by providing true Bitbucket Pipeline compatibility  
**User Value:** Reduces development cycle time by 60% through local testing  

**Success Metrics:**
- Execute simple pipeline steps in <5 seconds
- 100% container cleanup success rate
- Support for 90% of common Bitbucket Pipeline features
- Zero Docker dependency conflicts

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer managing CI/CD pipelines,  
**I want** the bitbucket-runner to execute pipeline steps in isolated Docker containers,  
**so that** I can test my Bitbucket Pipelines locally with the same environment isolation and behavior as the cloud service, reducing debugging time and improving development velocity.

## Dependencies
- ✅ **Story 1.1:** Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)
- ⚠️ **External:** Docker daemon must be available on target systems
- 📋 **Architecture:** Execution patterns defined in architecture document

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality (Must Have)
1. **Docker Integration:** Tool successfully connects to Docker daemon and handles connection failures gracefully with clear error messages
2. **Container Lifecycle:** Can create, start, execute commands in, and destroy containers with 100% cleanup success rate
3. **Step Execution:** Executes pipeline steps with commands/scripts in containers and captures exit codes (0 = success, >0 = failure)
4. **Sequential Processing:** Processes pipeline steps in order, stopping on first failure unless configured otherwise
5. **Output Capture:** Captures and displays stdout/stderr in real-time with <100ms latency for responsive feedback

### Quality & Performance (Must Have)
6. **Environment Handling:** Correctly merges and passes pipeline-level and step-level environment variables to containers
7. **Resource Management:** Implements container resource limits (memory, CPU) and enforces cleanup within 30 seconds of step completion
8. **Error Handling:** Provides meaningful error messages for common failure scenarios (Docker unavailable, image pull failures, timeout)

### Observability (Must Have)
9. **Structured Logging:** Generates JSON-formatted logs with timestamps, step context, and execution events for debugging
10. **Performance Tracking:** Records and reports step execution times and resource usage statistics

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements **Phase 2: Execution Engine** from the Implementation Roadmap [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#implementation-roadmap]. The goal is to add Docker integration and step execution capabilities to the foundation established in Story 1.1.

### Tech Stack Requirements
- **Docker SDK:** github.com/docker/docker for container management [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Logging:** structured JSON logging with configurable levels [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Context:** Go context for cancellation and timeout support [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#tech-stack]

### Docker Integration Specifications
**Container Service** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#components]:
- Purpose: Manages Docker container lifecycle
- Key operations: Create, start, stop, remove containers
- Configuration: Resource limits, networking, volumes

**Step Executor** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#components]:
- Purpose: Executes individual pipeline steps in containers
- Key operations: Script execution, output capture, error handling
- Integration: Works with container service and logging

### Execution Model
**Sequential Execution** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#adr-004]:
- Execute steps one by one in order
- Stop on first failure (configurable)
- Capture and display output in real-time
- Clean up containers after each step

**Environment Handling** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#environment-management]:
- Merge pipeline-level and step-level environment variables
- Support for secret placeholders (implementation in Phase 3)
- Pass environment to container execution

### Logging Requirements
**Structured Logging** [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#logging]:
- JSON format for machine readability
- Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Execution events: step start, step end, container operations
- Error context: container logs, exit codes, timing

### Testing Requirements
- **Integration Tests:** Test Docker container operations
- **Unit Tests:** Test execution logic and logging
- **Mock Tests:** Test without Docker dependency
- **Error Scenarios:** Test container failures and cleanup

### Key Design Decisions
- **Native Docker SDK:** Use Docker Go SDK instead of CLI wrapping [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#adr-003]
- **Sequential Execution:** Start with simple sequential step execution [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#adr-004]
- **Structured Logging:** JSON logging for observability [Source: bitbucket-runner-architecture.md#logging]

## Quality Assurance Plan
